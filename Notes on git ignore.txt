Git ignore ignores certain file extensions while commiting changes


for that we need to have `.gitignore` file. This file will contain the extensions which will be ignored while
commiting changes.

Custom File names or extensions can also be added in this file, example

1. ABC.txt --> will ignore this file while commiting.

2 .*.txt --> will ignore all the txt files while commiting.


New commands
ls -la --> will show .gitignore file in file list

cat abc.txt --> will show contents of abc.txt
